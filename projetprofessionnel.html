        <p class="text-justify">
         My future projects are guided by a strong desire to grow, contribute, and create lasting impact in the field of networks and telecommunications. As I pursue my engineering studies at IMT Atlantique, I aim to join a company through an apprenticeship program, where I can apply my knowledge and gain real-world experience. My ambition is to continue with this same company after graduation through a full-time position (CDI), and progressively grow within it as a way of showing gratitude to the organization that believed in me from the very beginning.
    I aspire to be an active contributor to innovative, secure, and sustainable digital solutions that shape the future. My journey is structured around three progressive phases.
