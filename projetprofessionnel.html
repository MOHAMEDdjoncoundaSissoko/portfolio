        <p class="text-justify">
          My future projects are part of a dynamic of exploration and impact. Driven by the desire to deepen my knowledge in the field of networks and telecommunications, I plan to specialize further in an engineering school. My aspiration is to contribute to technological innovation by developing intelligent and sustainable solutions. At the same time, I intend to share my knowledge by participating in educational initiatives, aimed at democratizing access to emerging technologies. Consequently, my future projects are divided into four phases.

          <h5 class="text-light " >Phase 1</h5>
          <p><em>After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Networks and Telecommunications</em></p>
          <p>My intention is to continue my studies at an engineering
            school here in France to deepen my knowledge in cybersecurity.
           Once graduated, my goal is to start my professional career in France, a country known for its expertise in Networks and Telecommunications.

           <h5 class="text-light" >Phase 2</h5>
           <p><em>After acquiring a broad competence in the field</em></p>
           <p class="justify-content-center">I plan to return to my country, Mali,
             to contribute to strengthening digital defense capabilities. I
              intend to establish my consulting firm to implement training programs, 
              cybersecurity consultations, and awareness initiatives to help Malian businesses, the government, 
              and the community protect against digital threats. By contributing to the digital protection of my country, I would participate in the emergence of a strong and secure digital ecosystem.

            <p><em>Deploy a network to connect the people</em></p>
            <p>Furthermore, I wish to explore innovative approaches in cybersecurity, 
              specifically designed to meet the unique needs and challenges of the people
              of Mali. By deploying advanced communication networks, Mali could benefit 
             from online education and economic development, thanks to enhanced connectivity between businesses and rural areas. Moreover, 
             connectivity would open up new opportunities for Malian farmers, artisans, and entrepreneurs
              by providing them with expanded access to a broader market.

            <p><em>The ultimate goal of my professional project</em></p>
            <p>Is to encourage major global companies to establish servers in my country, which 
              could have an economic impact by reducing unemployment rates in Mali, creating employment opportunities, 
              and fostering long-term development. This project could potentially promote economic development, access to healthcare,
             education, and social inclusion across the country.
             <br>In conclusion, the ultimate objective of this initiative is to elevate my homeland to the pinnacle 
             of innovation in the field of Networks & Telecommunications and beyond, while expanding horizons for national economic 
             growth, health, education, and social inclusion.
